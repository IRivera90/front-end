## Planning Story
As a group we decided that mob going and pair programming would be the best way to tackle our project. We assigned a scrum master and began to work out our project into small managable tasks that we could assign to different pairs or decide to tackle together. We created our resources together with mob coding as well as working out our ERD and wireframes together. From there we broke up smaller and more managable tasks to different people by white boarding our next steps and creating issues for each one so we could keep track. After a pieces of code were built we came together to push, merge, and rebase our code.

### Unsolved Problems

- Currently our update survey only updates our survey question and not the answers in the survey
- We have not displayed the answers/stats for a survey for the user to look at before taking

### Stretch Goals

- We would like to add a toggle function to our show all survey button that shows all surveys on first click and then hides them when you click again
